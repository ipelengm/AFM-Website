                    <h1>Financial Seminar with Dr Adora Domingo</h1>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <p>It was a money-saving weekend at AFM Upper Room with Dr Adora Domingo in the house teaching about the importance of financial
                    stability and security in Jesus Christ. The seminar started on Friday 23rd in the evening service. It started with a great
                    praise and worship and a prayer, an Upper speciality. Pastor Ngcobo thereafter introduced the speaker of the weekend, Dr
                    Adora Domingo a finance specialist, business man and Pastor of his own church to take the stage. At that moment the financial
                    lives of the brethren were gently steered in the correct direction. Financial advice was given yet based on scriptures, an
                    important element that stood out for most. He quoted these following verses: Psalm 119: 130, 35:21. From these he emphasized
                    that it was important that all children of God began hearing, believing and understanding the word of God. In Proverbs 22:7
                    it proven that to all why all man is after money. “When you don’t have money you don’t have many questions,” said Dr Domingo,
                    a smile upon his face. Thereafter it was clarified that God wants all his children to understand money. Over the course of
                    the weekend Dr Domingo emphasized on the importance of financial stability. Gently he took the church carefully through the
                    necessities of saving money, planning for money usage, recording transactions and involving God in all financial decisions.
                    He made it clear that money nowadays is used aimlessly hence why most find themselves in debt! In Isaiah 48:7 it proven that
                    God reaches his children to be profitable and he teaches them by his word and sometimes through his holy spirit. An important
                    note: the Holy Spirit is there to help the children of God in anything as the advisor, the counsellor (John 14:16) he promised
                    before he ascended back to heaven. “Saving is putting aside today’s money for the future,” said Dr Domingo placing much emphasis
                    on the importance of saving. He said it was for the children of God to put upon themselves to forget certain pleasure and
                    spend less today so that a bit of money is stored up and can be used for the future. It is also important that something
                    is put aside for the future (Pro 6:8). The first thing anyone should do believer or non-believer is to store money! It is
                    important that everyone understands the hierarchy of needs. Pay closer attention to important needs that need to be sustained
                    like the word of God first, stable food for the flesh and water forever. Expensive objects are not a necessity, a need but
                    only a want. People who spend too much are in fact struggling with the flesh and it is dominating them (Pro 21:20). As long
                    as the flesh dominates saving is impossible! “If you don’t plan for your money someone is going to plan for you and you will
                    only be financially stable and sound if you plan,” said Dr Domingo. God delights in the prosperity of his children. He has
                    good thought for his children. Financial soundness and peace is meant for God’s people and He likes that. Success glorifies
                    God’s name (Psa 35:27). God wants everyone to do good also in the church. He wants everyone to do well! He can never let
                    a person distribute if they don’t have anything to distribute. So everyone must not be stingy with what God has given them
                    because he can also take it away (Pro 11: 23-24). To conclude the whole seminar Dr Domingo encouraged that after the pastor
                    has communicated the word, shared some wisdom with the church so should it share also with him. Everyone must be able to
                    communicate with the pastor as stated in Galatians 6:6. “When the earth produces it receives from God. A curse is cause be
                    disobedience,” said Dr Domingo, quoting Hebrews 6: 7-9. Pledges were encouraged based on the word of God in the book of Ecclesiastes
                    5:4 and God’s people responded well, stepping forward to pledge to the church, to God. May the Lord richly bless them. The
                    seminar was a success!
